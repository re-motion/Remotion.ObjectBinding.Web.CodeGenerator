The initial revision of this project isn't.

This project has been separated from the re-motion trunk on
2009-07-08. Thus it has a much longer history than can be
seen in from the repository. 

The old sample code that was part of the uigen.exe project
has been removed. The new sample code is the PhoneBook example.
